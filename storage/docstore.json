So, it bears unpacking a bit.\n\n_You\u2019re reading_ [_The Protocol_](https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/the-protocol/) _, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time._ [_Sign up here_](https://www.coindesk.com/newsletters/the-protocol/) _to get it in your inbox every Wednesday._\n\nThe cause of the temporary loss of block finality remains under investigation, though Prysm, a provider of client software used to run a node on the blockchain, just [released a new version](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases/tag/v4.0.4), describing it as \u201cthe first full release following the recent mainnet issues,\u201d with \u201ccritical fixes.\u201d\n\nWhen data blocks don\u2019t finalize, there isn\u2019t supposed to be any downtime or difference in end-user experience. That said, a loss in finality can lead to some security issues like [reorgs](https://www.coindesk.com/video/what-ethereum-beacon-chains-reorg-means-for-users-and-developers/embed/).\n\nReorgs [occur when a blockchain](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-a-reorg) produces more than one block at the same time, usually because of a bug or an attack. This means that a validator node temporarily creates a new version of a blockchain, which makes it difficult to properly verify if a transaction has been successful, while the old version of the blockchain continues to exist.\n\nHowever, snowball effects from this incident led to some end-user jolts. DYdX, a leading crypto exchange platform, had to [temporarily pause deposits](https://status.dydx.exchange/incidents/p1p39vxv6z6z) because of one of last week\u2019s incidents, and Polygon\u2019s zkEVM also experienced some delays with deposits.\n\n![CoinDesk - Unknown](https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coindesk/OADAYZUWDBB6XGZXJKVQNYWHGU.png)The chart shows a spike in missed validator slots last week as the Ethereum blockchain temporarily stopped finalizing transactions. (Glassnode)\n\n## So how does finalization work?\n\nIn a [proof-of-stake](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-proof-of-stake/) blockchain like Ethereum\u2019s, validators first have to propose a block that contains transactions. Once those are proposed, other validators have to sign off on the block to permanently add it to the blockchain, which takes about 15 minutes. Once it is approved, or \u201cattested,\u201d by two-thirds of validators, the block eventually becomes finalized.\n\nThus, [finality is the point](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/top-questions-about-proof-of-stake-and-staking-answered/) where transactions on a blockchain are considered immutable. Finality is supposed to guarantee that transactions within a block cannot be altered.\n\nIf finality cannot be guaranteed, the blockchain enters an emergency state called the \" [inactivity leak](https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/incentives/inactivity/),\" where validators receive", "doc_id": "4cc59be2-78e2-4b28-bd75-61643e125d30", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "bf437f64946b1963bd29d88498348f207c45a1a83cdb17e4e5759f76c7dddbb1", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3338}, "relationships": {"1": "c90209b4-9b27-4b45-875f-0ec932fbd767", "3": "db5ecedd-f4b0-4984-9afa-7e524959f712"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "db5ecedd-f4b0-4984-9afa-7e524959f712": {"__data__": {"text": "Once those are proposed, other validators have to sign off on the block to permanently add it to the blockchain, which takes about 15 minutes.

Finality is supposed to guarantee that transactions within a block cannot be altered.\n\nIf finality cannot be guaranteed, the blockchain enters an emergency state called the \" [inactivity leak](https://eth2book.info/altair/part2/incentives/inactivity/),\" where validators receive penalties for not reaching finalization. When the state is triggered, it acts as a way to incentive the blockchain to start finalizing again. The incident last week triggered Ethereum's first-ever inactivity leak.\n\nThe Ethereum community has acknowledged that the current timeframe for blocks to be finalized is too long.\n\n\u201cHaving a delay between a block's proposal and finalization also creates an opportunity for short reorgs that an attacker could use to censor certain blocks or extract [MEV](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-mev-aka-maximal-extractable-value/),\u201d the Ethereum website shared [in a blog](https://ethereum.org/de/roadmap/single-slot-finality/).\n\nEthereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was [writing about finality seven years ago](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/05/09/on-settlement-finality), an indication of just how important an issue it is.\n\nWhen the [first loss of finality occurred on](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/11/ethereum-mainnet-was-unable-to-fully-finalize-transactions-for-25-minutes/) May 11, developers immediately shared it over Twitter, saying they were going to deploy extra help to figure out what was going on. After 25 minutes, the issue seemed to have been resolved and the chain resumed finalizing.\n\nRoughly 24 hours later, [the chain stopped finalizing again for about an hour](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/12/ethereum-resumes-finalizing-blocks-after-second-performance-hiccup-in-24-hours/), which caused outages for some infrastructure providers.\n\nIn the past, finalization [has temporarily stopped because of bugs](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/14/staked-eth-withdrawals-being-processed-on-ethereum-goerli-testnet-ahead-of-shanghai-fork/) in client software used to run the blockchain. Ethereum has multiple clients in the event that there is a flaw or glitch in the software, so there are other options, and the activity on the blockchain can keep running.\n\n## How did this affect the applications?\n\nTim Beiko, protocol support lead at the Ethereum Foundation, told CoinDesk the incident is \u201cdefinitely significant, but it's not something where Ethereum\u2019s security or soundness is at risk or compromised.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin minutes, things were corrected and within like a day or two clients had software patches to make sure that this specific case did not come up again,\u201d he said.\n\nThe developers are still looking to understand what caused the blockchain to stop finalizing, and are expected to discuss a post-mortem report in their upcoming Consensus Layer call.\n\nBeiko told CoinDesk that the incident did not get to a point \u201cwhere we began to test the very extreme fallbacks in the protocol to deal with this stuff.\u201d\n\nThe incidents did affect several applications that run on top of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nJordi Baylina, technical lead at Polygon, said that the finality stoppage meant that deposits onto the Polygon", "doc_id": "db5ecedd-f4b0-4984-9afa-7e524959f712", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c34574ddd4274331fe4293555ba3eb3b1867d5dc40d45c893bc9706b9b0daf28", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 2714, "end": 6312}, "relationships": {"1": "c90209b4-9b27-4b45-875f-0ec932fbd767", "2": "4cc59be2-78e2-4b28-bd75-61643e125d30", "3": "0b6ef448-b678-48a3-af99-dae19f7e763e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b6ef448-b678-48a3-af99-dae19f7e763e": {"__data__": {"text": "security or soundness is at risk or compromised.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithin minutes, things were corrected and within like a day or two clients had software patches to make sure that this specific case did not come up again,\u201d he said.\n\nThe developers are still looking to understand what caused the blockchain to stop finalizing, and are expected to discuss a post-mortem report in their upcoming Consensus Layer call.\n\nBeiko told CoinDesk that the incident did not get to a point \u201cwhere we began to test the very extreme fallbacks in the protocol to deal with this stuff.\u201d\n\nThe incidents did affect several applications that run on top of the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nJordi Baylina, technical lead at Polygon, said that the finality stoppage meant that deposits onto the Polygon zkEVM chain were delayed, and since the chain relied on Infura, an infrastructure provider which also temporarily had an outage as a result of the loss in finality, issues for individuals using the zkEVM compounded.\n\n\u201cYou need to wait for the finality in layer 1 deposit to be available in layer 2,\u201d Balyina said. \u201cSo until you don't have finality, you cannot use \\[the chain\\] or you have the risk of double spending in layer 2.\u201d\n\nDYdX paused its [deposits temporarily](https://status.dydx.exchange/incidents/p1p39vxv6z6z) today due to the lack of Ethereum finality and said it was \u201ccontinuing to monitor and investigate this issue.\u201d\n\nDespite this, Ethereum developers emphasize that the network did not go down.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s incident has been a great fire drill.

Even though the NFT could be listed for trading on Blur and Opensea, according to Lido marketing lead Kasper Rasmussen, \u201csecondary market activity does not play a role in the withdrawal process.\u201d\n\nCommanding about nearly 80% market share of liquid staking derivatives on Ethereum, per blockchain analytics firm [Nansen](https://query.nansen.ai/public/dashboards/Hk93n66vsO0uvycfui8ypF2xcpNhpraxfwX5AWZJ?utm_campaign=shanghaiupgrade_12apr23&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter), Lido has already withdrawn more than 278,000 ETH at press time, making the staking giant the fourth largest entity by ETH withdrawals, trailing crypto exchanges - Kraken, Coinbase and Binance.\n\nLido said the new V2 received [nine total audits](https://t.co/rLrf4lHLTS) from several firms, such as Statemind and MixBytes. All have been completed except for one by Oxorio which is expected to finish at the end of May.\n\nThe change to v2 is important because it is \u201cderisking the entire Lido tech stack,\u201d said Vice President of Stanford Blockchain Club, who goes by the screen name Kydo. \u201cToday\u2019s events show you can both enter and exit the staking house, which has to derisk the staking experience in some way or another,\u201d Rasmussen added.\n\nEdited by Bradley Keoun.", "doc_id": "374a437e-30db-48f2-a7a6-c0d116fe129e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "451e5b43e594d149d3db9fe64c259f454c8a3fff391b03a41452b8e62c640e39", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2442}, "relationships": {"1": "cfdbcda9-f269-4217-93bb-d64c5644c33f"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
