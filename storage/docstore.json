These changes can range from deploying treasury funds to purposes that benefit the project to expansion on other networks.\n\nAt the start of the weekend, the attacker floated a malicious proposal that hid a code function that granted them fake votes that can now be used to handle some aspects of Tornado Cash, such as torn (TORN) tokens held in the main governance contract or withdrawal of locked torn tokens.\n\nThis was done by putting forth a proposal that imitated an earlier version \u2013 except with some malicious code that allowed for the update of logic that gave the attacker access to all governance votes.\n\n\u201cNow that they have all the votes, they can do whatever they want,\u201d security research @samczsun tweeted on Sunday. \u201cIn this case, they simply withdrew 10,000 votes as TORN and sold it all.\u201d\n\nAs such, this attack does not impact the actual Tornado Cash protocol \u2013 which allows users to pass funds through the service to mask or obscure the movements of funds and crypto addresses. This attack was not an exploit of any smart contracts or technology related to the working of Tornado Cash.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tornado Cash community has put up newer proposals that seek to revert [changes made to the code](https://forums.tornadocash.community/t/proposal-to-revert-state-changes/180). One community member observed that the attacker had [maliciously minted](https://forums.tornadocash.community/t/proposal-to-revert-state-changes/180) over 1 million torn for themselves, worth over $4 million at current prices.\n\nOthers suggested making a new contract altogether and airdropping [new tokens to holders](https://forums.tornadocash.community/t/proposal-to-revert-state-changes/180/3).\n\nTorn prices slumped as much as 40% in the past 24 hours as a result of the governance attack, [data shows](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tornado-cash).", "doc_id": "01f261dd-5140-4158-b60b-e7e69fef25af", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "eb0de4c89fe619f7e5f1196205f09ac9811846817c2c45580e47a9c7eb5a3501", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2185}, "relationships": {"1": "dd997927-5706-4ed8-ab90-2ffceb044b33"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
